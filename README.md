# CPP-Open-Addressing-Hash-Tables
C++ implementations of open addressing hash tables with different probing methods.
## About
I started learning about hash tables while attending Data Structures classes by professor [Igor Machado Coelho](https://igormcoelho.github.io/sobre). Since then, I also decided to go further looking into about both open addressing hash tables and C++ to complement my studies.
## Things to do
* Implement entry class
* Implement traditional quadratic probing and...
    * Table's functions
    * Table's entry hash caching
    * Table's caching
* Implement triangular quadratic probing
* Implement alternated signs quadratic probing
* Implement linear hashing
* Implement double hashing
* Implement multithreading, if possible
* Look into Fowler–Noll–Vo hash function
* Write some docs explaning used methods
